# Biography
[RESUME](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ydotMWdv0nm_wOXLgu7pLF5_w07FZ-T9/view?usp=sharing)

I am currently a Master's Student at NYU and have recieved the Samuel Morse Fellowship. I have completed my undergraduate from [IIT Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) majoring in Electrical Engineering. I am currently looking for research opportunities in NYU. I am broadly interested in deep learning and its application in Computer Vision and NLP and the interplay between the two. During my time as an undergraduate I have worked with [Prof. Yao Wang](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/yao-wang) from [NYU](http://nyu.edu) on a couple of projects and had the fortune of visiting New York to work with her. During my junior year, I enjoyed a stirring couple of months at [Artifacia](http://artifacia.com), an AI startup dealing with visual commerce. 

Apart from academics, I am interested in playing tennis, writing poetry and painting. I have been part of a couple of interesting startup projects [LucidLaw](http://lucidlaw.in) and [MeetApp](https://fb.com/realmeetapp) under [Epoch Solutions](https://epoch.solutions) an initial stage startup cofounded by me and a couple of undergrads unlike myself.
