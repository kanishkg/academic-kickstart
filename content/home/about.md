# Biography

I am currently working with [Prof. Brenden Lake] (https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/) at the [Human & Machine Learning Lab] (https://cims.nyu.edu/~brenden/lab-website/resources.html) on studying and analysing biases in neural networks. I am currently a Master's Student at NYU and have recieved the Samuel Morse Fellowship. I have completed my undergraduate from [IIT Kanpur](http://iitk.ac.in) majoring in Electrical Engineering.  I am broadly interested in using concepts in cognitive science like compositionality, causality and learning to learn to bring structure to deep neural nets. During my time as an undergraduate I have worked with [Prof. Yao Wang](http://engineering.nyu.edu/people/yao-wang) from [NYU](http://nyu.edu) on a couple of projects and had the fortune of visiting New York to work with her. During my junior year, I enjoyed a stirring couple of months at [Artifacia](http://artifacia.com), an AI startup dealing with visual commerce. 

I am interested in playing tennis, visiting museums, writing poetry and painting. I have been part of a couple of interesting startup projects [LucidLaw](http://lucidlaw.in) and [MeetApp](https://fb.com/realmeetapp) founded by me and a couple of undergrads unlike myself.
